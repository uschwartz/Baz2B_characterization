# Biochemical and cellular insights into the therapeutic protein Baz2B, a non-catalytic subunit of chromatin remodeling complex

Baz2B is a regulatory subunit of the ATP-dependent BRF1 and BRF5 chromatin remodeling complexes that control the access to DNA during DNA-templated processes. Baz2B is linked with various diseases and also to unhealthy aging, yet information about the Baz2B domains and cellular role is limited. To gain more insights into the Baz2B function we biochemically characterized the TAM (Tip5/ARBP/MBD) domain with the auxiliary AT-hooks and bromodomain (BRD). Furthermore, we analyzed the bromodomains carrying the cancer-associated point mutations and, strikingly, some of them displayed a change in histone code recognition. Moreover, the absence of Baz2B in the Hap1 cell line changed the cellular morphology, decreased the colony formation and proliferation, and affected the transcription profile, however, the overall chromatin structure stayed unaffected as our super-resolution microscopy images revealed. These findings provide clues for the biological function of Baz2B and we believe, it will have implications for the development of compounds to treat diseases and aging.
